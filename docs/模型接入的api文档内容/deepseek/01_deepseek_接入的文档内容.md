Your First API Call
The DeepSeek API uses an API format compatible with OpenAI/Anthropic. By modifying the configuration, you can use the OpenAI/Anthropic SDK or softwares compatible with the OpenAI/Anthropic API to access the DeepSeek API.

* The model names deepseek-chat and deepseek-reasoner will be deprecated on 2026/07/24. For compatibility, they correspond to the non-thinking mode and thinking mode of deepseek-v4-flash, respectively.

Integrate with Agent Tools
The DeepSeek API is supported by many popular AI agent and coding assistant tools. If you use tools like Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, or OpenCode, you can use DeepSeek as the backend model directly — no code required.

See the Agent Integrations Guide for details.

Invoke The Chat API
Once you have obtained an API key, you can access the DeepSeek model using the following example scripts in the OpenAI API format. This is a non-stream example, you can set the stream parameter to true to get stream response.

For examples using the Anthropic API format, please refer to Anthropic API.

python
nodejs
curl https://api.deepseek.com/chat/completions \
